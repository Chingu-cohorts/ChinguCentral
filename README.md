# ChinguCentral (WIP)
The home for the Chingu Cohorts. It will host a list of all the cohorts, along with their members, completed projects and forums. Each member will have a profile in which he will be able to display his contact information, it will also show the projects he/she has participated on, a probably in the near future some medals, because who doesn't like medals?

**This is in very early stages of development, a lot of stuff needs to be done. Find a list of critical stuff [here](https://github.com/Oxyrus/ChinguCentral/projects/1)**

## Setup
You must have Golang v1.6+, Node v6.10+ and MongoDB v3.0+.

1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/Oxyrus/ChinguCentral.git`
2. Compile the Go code `cd ChinguCentral && go build`
3. Run the compiled file
4. Install node dependencies `cd client && npm install`
5. Run the server `npm start`
6. Enjoy!

## Wireframes

## Stack
* API - Golang
* Client - ReactJS
* Database - MongoDB?

## Roadmap
I have never done a roadmap before, so bear with me.

The idea is to setup the user system (registration/login), the list of cohorts with all the users who are members of them and the projects they have completed.
