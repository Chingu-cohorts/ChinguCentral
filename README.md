2. Compile the Go code `cd ChinguCentral && go build`
3. Run the compiled file

## Roadmap
I have never done a roadmap before, so bear with me.

The idea is to setup the user system (registration/login), the list of cohorts with all the users who are members of them and the projects they have completed.
