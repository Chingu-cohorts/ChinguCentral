# ChinguCentral

So far, there is no client. Only an API that is being developed.

We're using Phoenix 1.3, Elixir 1.4 and GraphQL for our API endpoint.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:8080/graphiql`](http://localhost:8080/graphiql) from your browser and play around with the API.

If you want to deploy the API, check out [Phoenix docs](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/deployment).
